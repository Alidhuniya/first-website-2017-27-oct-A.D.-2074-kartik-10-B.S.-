In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990.<br>
Berners-Lee is the son of British mathematicians and computer scientists Mary Lee Woods and Conway Berners-Lee, who worked on the first commercially-built electronic computer, the Ferranti Mark 1.<br></p><p style="font-size:3vw" style="color: brown">  From Wikipedia:Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee OM KBE FRS FREng FRSA FBCS (born 8 June 1955), also known as TimBL, is an English engineer and computer scientist, best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web. He made a proposal for an information management system in March 1989, and he implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the internet in mid-November the same year.
Berners-Lee is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which oversees the continued development of the Web. He is also the founder of the World Wide Web Foundation and is a senior researcher and holder of the founders chair at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).[9] He is a director of the Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI),[10] and a member of the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. In 2011, he was named as a member of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation. He is a founder and president of the Open Data Institute.
In 2004, Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his pioneering work. In April 2009, he was elected a foreign associate of the United States National Academy of Sciences. Named in Time magazine's list of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century, Berners-Lee has received a number of other accolades for his invention. He was honoured as the "Inventor of the World Wide Web" during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, in which he appeared in person, working with a vintage NeXT Computer at the London Olympic Stadium. He tweeted "This is for everyone", which instantly was spelled out in LCD lights attached to the chairs of the 80,000 people in the audience.Berners-Lee received the 2016 Turing Award "for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale".<br>

		<p style="font-size:3vw"  style="color: red">*Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered(given) on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.</p>
		<p style="font-size:3vw"  style="color: black">*CSS is a language that describes the style of an HTML document.

CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.</p>
<p  style="font-size:3vw" style="color: blue">
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.<br>

- Cascading refers to the way CSS applies one style on top of another.<br>
- Style Sheets control the look and feel of web documents.<br>

CSS and HTML work hand in hand:<br>
- HTML sorts out the page structure.<br>
- CSS defines how HTML elements are displayed.<br</p>
<p style="font-size:3vw"><strong>From Wikipedia:</strong> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language.[1] Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.</p>
<p style="font-size:3vw">
CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of presentation and content, including aspects such as the layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>
<p style="font-size:3vw" >
Separation of formatting and content makes it possible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. It can also display the web page differently depending on the screen size or viewing device. Readers can also specify a different style sheet, such as a CSS file stored on their own computer, to override the one the author specified.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:5vw"><strong>FRONTEND VS BACKEND</strong></h1></center>
<p style="font-size:3vw"><strong>Frontend:Simply Front scene.</strong> HTML,CSS & Js are the Frontend Developement which means the written code can be visible by user(client) that's why it is also known as Client Side.</p>
<p style="font-size:3vw"><strong>Backend:Behind the scene.</strong>Python,Php,Java etc are the Backend Developement which refer as Server Side means that part of the code is stored on server.For instance,Those websites which contain payement <br>method through card(debit,credit,master,visa etc) like Udemy,Treehouse & other called as Backend Developement/Server Side.The method of payement process done on server which client/user can't see.</p>
